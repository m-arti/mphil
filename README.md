# MPhil
This repository contains code and other resources from my MPhil research at Queen's University Belfast, including my thesis.

## Thesis

The title of my thesis is __Exploring Text Representations for Online Misinformation__.
Its layout was inspired by those of 
[Aaron Turon](https://aturon.github.io/academic/turon-thesis.pdf) and [Friedrich Wiemer](https://hss-opus.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/opus4/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/7044/file/diss.pdf). The original thesis template is called [_ClassicThesis_](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis).

I have added a folder containing the files needed to reproduce the layout of mine.

## Resources
The [InfoDis](https://github.com/m-arti/infodis) repository contains resources for learning about, teaching and researching Information Disorder. It covers a wide range of topics, including policy and everyday detection of mis- and disinformation.
